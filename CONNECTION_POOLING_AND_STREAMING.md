# Connection Pooling and Streaming Patterns for Epsilon

This document describes the modern connection pooling and streaming patterns implemented for epsilon, designed to provide high-performance, reusable abstractions inspired by Rust and Go.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Rust-Inspired Ownership and Safety
- **Resource Management**: Automatic cleanup with `unwind-protect` patterns
- **Thread Safety**: Mutex-protected shared state similar to `Arc<Mutex<T>>`
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with validation at boundaries

### 2. Go-Inspired Concurrency Patterns
- **Channels**: Bounded FIFO channels with backpressure
- **Goroutine-style**: Thread-based producers and consumers
- **Select-like Operations**: Non-blocking channel operations

### 3. Functional Programming Integration
- **Immutable Configurations**: Configuration objects are immutable
- **Stream Processing**: Lazy evaluation with composable operations
- **Error Handling**: Condition-based error propagation

## Core Abstractions

### 1. Object Pooling (epsilon.pool)

**Key Features:**
- Generic object pooling with configurable lifecycle
- Thread-safe resource management
- Health checking and maintenance
- Statistics and monitoring

**Usage Pattern:**
```lisp
(let ((pool (pool:make-pool 
             :factory #'create-connection
             :destroyer #'close-connection
             :validator #'connection-alive-p
             :max-size 10)))
  
  (pool:with-resource (conn pool)
    (use-connection conn)))
```

**Rust Influence:**
- Similar to `deadpool` or `r2d2` crates
- RAII-style resource management
- Strong type safety with validation

### 2. Channels and Streaming (epsilon.channel)

**Key Features:**
- Bounded channels with backpressure
- Stream processing with lazy evaluation
- Composable stream operations
- Error propagation through streams

**Usage Pattern:**
```lisp
;; Channel communication
(let ((ch (channel:create-channel :capacity 10)))
  (channel:send ch "message")
  (channel:receive ch))

;; Stream processing
(-> (channel:from-sequence '(1 2 3 4 5))
    (channel:map-stream (lambda (x) (* x 2)))
    (channel:filter-stream #'evenp)
    (channel:collect-stream))
```

**Go Influence:**
- Channel semantics similar to Go channels
- Select-like operations for non-blocking communication
- Fan-in/fan-out patterns

**Rust Influence:**
- Iterator-like stream operations
- Lazy evaluation and zero-cost abstractions
- Composable transformations

### 3. HTTP Connection Pooling (epsilon.http.pool)

**Key Features:**
- Per-host connection pools
- HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support
- Connection reuse and keep-alive
- Automatic cleanup and health checking

**Usage Pattern:**
```lisp
(let ((pool (pool:make-http-connection-pool)))
  (pool:pooled-get pool "https://api.example.com/data"))
```

### 4. HTTP Streaming (epsilon.http.streaming)

**Key Features:**
- Chunked transfer encoding
- Server-sent events (SSE)
- Large file uploads/downloads with progress
- Backpressure-aware streaming

**Usage Pattern:**
```lisp
;; Streaming download
(streaming:stream-file-download 
  pool "https://example.com/largefile.zip" output-stream
  :progress-callback #'show-progress)

;; Server-sent events
(let ((event (streaming:make-sse-event :type "update" :data "Hello")))
  (streaming:write-sse-event stream event))
```

## Design Patterns

### 1. Resource Pool Pattern

**Problem**: Managing expensive resources (connections, threads, etc.)
**Solution**: 
- Factory functions create resources on demand
- Destroyer functions clean up resources
- Validator functions check resource health
- Pool manages lifecycle automatically

**Benefits**:
- Reduced resource creation overhead
- Automatic resource cleanup
- Health monitoring and maintenance
- Thread-safe access

### 2. Channel Pattern

**Problem**: Thread-safe communication with backpressure
**Solution**:
- Bounded FIFO channels
- Blocking and non-blocking operations
- Automatic cleanup when closed

**Benefits**:
- Backpressure prevents memory exhaustion
- Clean shutdown semantics
- Composable with other patterns

### 3. Stream Processing Pattern

**Problem**: Processing large data sets efficiently
**Solution**:
- Lazy evaluation prevents memory explosion
- Composable operations for transformation
- Error propagation through the pipeline

**Benefits**:
- Memory efficient for large datasets
- Reusable transformations
- Clean error handling

### 4. Connection Pool Per Host Pattern

**Problem**: HTTP connection management across multiple hosts
**Solution**:
- Separate pools per host:port:protocol combination
- Automatic connection reuse within pools
- Health checking and maintenance

**Benefits**:
- Optimal connection reuse
- Host-specific configuration
- Automatic cleanup

## Implementation Details

### Thread Safety

All core abstractions are thread-safe using:
- Mutexes for protecting shared state
- Condition variables for coordination
- Lock-free operations where possible

### Memory Management

- Automatic resource cleanup with `unwind-protect`
- Reference counting for shared resources
- Weak references to prevent cycles

### Error Handling

- Structured error conditions
- Error propagation through streams
- Graceful degradation on failures

### Performance Optimizations

- Lock-free fast paths where possible
- Batching for improved throughput
- Lazy initialization of expensive resources

## Ecosystem Integration

### With Other Epsilon Modules

The patterns integrate cleanly with existing epsilon modules:

- **epsilon.map**: Used for configuration and metadata
- **epsilon.sequence**: Stream operations work with sequences
- **epsilon.protocol**: Extensible interfaces for customization
- **epsilon.sys.thread**: Thread management and synchronization

### Extension Points

Modules can extend these patterns by:

1. **Custom Pool Types**: Implementing factory/destroyer/validator functions
2. **Stream Transformations**: Adding new stream operations
3. **Channel Types**: Specialized channel implementations
4. **Protocol Handlers**: HTTP-specific extensions

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Connection Pooling

- High-frequency operations to the same hosts
- Expensive connection setup (TLS, authentication)
- Need for connection reuse and keepalive

### When to Use Streaming

- Large data processing that doesn't fit in memory
- Real-time data processing with backpressure
- Composable data transformations

### When to Use Channels

- Inter-thread communication
- Producer-consumer patterns
- Fan-in/fan-out architectures

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Async/Await Support**: Integration with future async runtime
2. **Metrics Integration**: Built-in metrics collection
3. **Circuit Breakers**: Failure detection and isolation
4. **Load Balancing**: Intelligent connection distribution

### Extension Opportunities

1. **WebSocket Pooling**: Extend patterns to WebSocket connections
2. **Database Pooling**: Apply patterns to database connections
3. **Message Queues**: Channel-based message queue implementations
4. **Stream Analytics**: Real-time analytics using stream patterns

## Conclusion

These patterns provide a solid foundation for high-performance, concurrent applications in epsilon. By drawing inspiration from successful patterns in Rust and Go, while maintaining Lisp's expressiveness and functional programming principles, they offer both performance and developer productivity.

The patterns are designed to be:
- **Composable**: Work well together and with existing epsilon modules
- **Extensible**: Easy to adapt for new use cases
- **Performant**: Optimized for common use cases
- **Safe**: Thread-safe and memory-safe by design
