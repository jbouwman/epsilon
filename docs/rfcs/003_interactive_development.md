# Interactive Development Environment Roadmap

## Current Status

Epsilon provides basic REPL functionality through SBCL but lacks modern interactive development features. This roadmap outlines the development of a rich, web-based development environment.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (2-3 weeks)

### Low Difficulty Items
- **Symbol aliases**: Short aliases for common operations
  - `(m ...)` for `(map:make-map ...)`
  - `(s seq fn)` for `(seq:map fn seq)`
  - Context-specific abbreviations for frequent operations
- **Pretty printers**: Better PRINT-OBJECT methods for all data structures
  - Maps print as `{:key value, ...}`
  - Sets print as `#{element ...}`
  - Sequences with truncation for large collections
  - Nested structure formatting with proper indentation
- **REPL commands**: Common operations as REPL shortcuts
  - `:i object` - inspect object with expandable views
  - `:t function` - trace function execution
  - `:p expression` - profile expression performance
  - `:h symbol` - help/documentation lookup

## Phase 2: Smart REPL Package (3-4 weeks)

### Medium Difficulty Implementation
- **Context-aware symbol completion**: Intelligent suggestions based on current scope
- **Auto-import based on current working module**: Automatic package resolution
- **Symbol search across all loaded packages**: Global symbol discovery
- **Recent symbol history and favorites**: Persistent user preferences
- **Package alias management**: Avoid long prefixes with smart aliasing

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with epsilon.lsp for symbol information
- Persistent configuration using epsilon.lib.yaml
- Fast symbol indexing with epsilon.lib.map
- Command history with epsilon.sys.fs

## Phase 3: Inspector Framework (4-6 weeks)

### Core Inspector Features
- **Hierarchical object inspection**: Tree-based object navigation
- **Expandable/collapsible views**: Lazy loading for large objects
- **Type-specific inspectors**: Custom views for maps, sequences, functions
- **Edit-in-place for mutable slots**: Direct object modification
- **Navigation history**: Back/forward through inspection sessions
- **Export capabilities**: JSON, EDN, and other format exports

### Advanced Inspector Features
- **Visual data structure representation**: Graphical tree and graph views
- **Search within inspected objects**: Find values and keys in complex structures
- **Comparison mode**: Diff view between different objects or states
- **Memory usage analysis**: Object size and reference tracking

## Phase 4: Notebook Interface (6-8 weeks)

### Notebook-Style REPL Features
- **Cell-based evaluation**: Persistent results with execution order tracking
- **Markdown cells**: Rich documentation with code examples
- **Inline visualizations**: Tables, graphs, trees directly in notebook
- **Cell dependencies**: Automatic re-execution of dependent cells
- **Export capabilities**: HTML/PDF reports for sharing and documentation
- **WebSocket-based interface**: Remote access and collaborative editing

### Technical Implementation
- Web-based UI using epsilon.net.http
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Client-side rendering with modern JavaScript
- Server-side state management for notebook persistence

## Phase 5: Live System Browser (8-10 weeks)

### High Difficulty Advanced Features
- **Real-time module dependency visualization**: Interactive dependency graphs
- **Thread activity monitor**: Live stack traces and execution monitoring
- **Memory allocation heatmaps**: Visual memory usage patterns
- **Network connection status**: Live monitoring of network activity
- **Interactive debugging**: Breakpoints with live variable inspection
- **Performance profiling overlay**: Real-time performance metrics

### Browser Architecture
- D3.js-based visualizations for complex data
- Real-time data streaming for live updates
- Efficient diff algorithms for incremental updates
- Plugin architecture for custom views and metrics

## Phase 6: Time-Travel Debugging (10-12 weeks)

### Revolutionary Debugging Features
- **Record all state changes**: Comprehensive execution history
- **Step backwards through execution**: Reverse debugging capabilities
- **Replay with modifications**: "What if" debugging scenarios
- **Diff view between states**: Visual comparison of program states
- **Persistent history**: Post-mortem analysis of crashes and issues
- **Test integration**: Replay failed tests with full context

### Technical Challenges
- Efficient state snapshot algorithms
- Incremental change tracking
- Large history storage and retrieval
- Integration with garbage collector
- Performance impact minimization

## Implementation Roadmap
