# Project 6:6: Package Registry and Distribution

## Status
**Proposed** - Design phase

## Overview
Establish a centralized package registry for Epsilon modules with automated distribution and dependency management.

## Problem Statement
Currently, Epsilon modules exist only within the main repository. A package registry would enable:
- Third-party module distribution
- Versioned package management
- Automated dependency resolution
- Community ecosystem growth

## Solution Design

### Registry Infrastructure
- Central package repository with web interface
- Package metadata storage (versions, dependencies, checksums)
- Download statistics and usage metrics
- Search and discovery capabilities

### Package Format
- Standardized package.edn metadata format
- Version constraint specification
- Source code verification and integrity checks
- Documentation and example inclusion

### Distribution Mechanism
- Automated publishing from Git repositories
- Version tagging and release automation
- Binary and source distribution options
- Mirror support for availability

### Integration Points
- Extend epsilon.package module for registry interaction
- Command-line tools for publishing and installing
- Build system integration for dependency fetching
- IDE integration for package discovery

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Registry Service
- Design and implement registry backend API
- Create web interface for package browsing
- Establish package metadata schema
- Set up hosting infrastructure

### Phase 2: Client Tooling
- Extend package management commands
- Implement package installation workflow
- Add dependency resolution algorithms
- Create publishing tools for authors

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Integration
- Documentation generation from packages
- Quality metrics and testing integration
- Community features (ratings, comments)
- Deployment options

## Success Criteria
- Registry can host and serve packages reliably
- Package installation is automated
- Dependency conflicts are resolved automatically
- Community adoption demonstrates ecosystem value
