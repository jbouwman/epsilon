# Project 7:7: Functional Programming Extensions

## Status
**Proposed** - Research phase

## Overview
Enhance Epsilon's functional programming capabilities with additional language features and data structure optimizations.

## Problem Statement
While Epsilon provides functional data structures, it lacks some functional programming features found in languages like Clojure, Haskell, and other Lisps.

## Proposed Extensions

### Additional Sequence Operations
- Transducers for composable, efficient transformations
- Parallel sequence processing with work-stealing
- Streaming operations for large datasets
- Windowing and partitioning functions

### Pattern Matching
- Destructuring bind with type checking
- Pattern matching on data structures
- Guard clauses and conditional matching
- Integration with existing control structures

### Type System Enhancements
- Optional gradual typing system
- Type inference for common patterns
- Protocol-based polymorphism
- Generic function dispatch improvements

### Memory Management
- Persistent data structure optimizations
- Structural sharing improvements
- Memory-mapped large collections
- Garbage collection tuning for functional workloads

### Concurrency Primitives
- Software transactional memory (STM)
- Actor model implementation
- Async/await patterns for I/O
- Channel-based communication

## Implementation Considerations

### Performance Impact
- Benchmark all changes against current implementations
- Maintain backward compatibility for existing code
- Provide migration paths for performance-critical code
- Consider compilation strategies for optimization

### Language Integration
- Ensure features compose well with existing Lisp constructs
- Maintain readable syntax and clear semantics
- Provide error messages and debugging support
- Document functional programming practices

### Library Design
- Keep core small and focused
- Provide optional extensions for additional features
- Maintain separation between functional and imperative styles
- Enable incremental adoption of new features

## Success Criteria
- New features demonstrate performance improvements
- Code using functional extensions is more concise
- Memory usage is reduced for functional programming patterns
- Community adopts new features in applications

## Related Work
- Builds on data structures from epsilon.core
- May influence Project 7:2 (Testing) with property-based testing
- Could inform Project 7:5 (Async Networking) with concurrency primitives
