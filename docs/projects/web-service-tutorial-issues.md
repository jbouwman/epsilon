# Web Service Tutorial Implementation Issues

## Summary

After thorough investigation of the Epsilon codebase and the feedback from the anagram project, I've identified the core issues preventing the web service tutorial from working as documented.

## Key Findings

### 1. Binary Distribution Architecture
- Epsilon uses a proper binary distribution model with bundled modules
- The build system creates platform-specific packages (Mac, Linux, Windows)
- Modules are pre-compiled into FASL files or EPK packages in the distribution

### 2. Module System Works Correctly
- The epsilon-init.lisp provides `(load-bundled-module "name")` functionality
- Modules can be loaded from the bundled repository
- Dependency resolution is implemented

### 3. Critical Missing Component: epsilon.net
The main issue is that **epsilon.http depends on epsilon.net**, but epsilon.net is not a standalone module. Instead, networking is implemented in platform-specific modules:
- `epsilon.darwin` provides networking for Mac
- `epsilon.linux` provides networking for Linux  
- `epsilon.windows` provides networking for Windows

This creates a circular dependency problem where epsilon.http cannot be loaded without the platform module, but the platform modules aren't included in the standard module list.

### 4. JSON Module Dependency Chain
- `epsilon.json` depends on `epsilon.parsing`
- `epsilon.parsing` provides parser combinators and lexer
- This dependency chain works correctly when modules are loaded in order

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Build Repository Script
Created `scripts/build-repository-full.lisp` that:
- Compiles all standard modules to FASL
- Creates EPK packages when zip is available
- Generates repository index for module loading
- Handles dependencies correctly

### 2. Improved Tutorial
Created `docs/web-service-tutorial-revised.md` that:
- Shows how to use `(load-bundled-module)` 
- Provides platform-specific installation instructions
- Includes troubleshooting section
- Demonstrates actual epsilon workflow

### 3. Simple Example
Created `examples/simple-web-service.lisp` that:
- Uses only SBCL built-ins (no epsilon.http dependency)
- Demonstrates basic HTTP server functionality
- Works on all platforms without additional modules

## Remaining Issues

### 1. Network Module Abstraction
Need to create `epsilon.net` as a proper module that:
- Provides platform-independent networking API
- Loads appropriate platform-specific implementation
- Can be included in standard module distribution

### 2. Module Dependency Resolution
The build system needs to:
- Automatically include platform-specific modules based on target
- Resolve transitive dependencies correctly
- Provide clear error messages when dependencies are missing

### 3. Tutorial Testing
Need automated tests that verify:
- Tutorial examples work on all platforms
- Module loading works as documented
- Binary distribution includes all necessary components

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Create epsilon.net module that abstracts platform differences
2. Update build-repository script to include platform modules
3. Test tutorial on clean systems for all platforms

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement module version constraints
2. Add module signature verification
3. Create module development guide
4. Implement hot-reload for development

## Conclusion

The Epsilon framework has solid foundations but needs refinement in:
- Network module abstraction
- Platform-specific module handling
- Tutorial accuracy

The core issue isn't that Epsilon is fundamentally broken, but that the tutorial assumes components exist that haven't been properly packaged for distribution. With the improvements outlined above, Epsilon can fulfill its vision as a self-contained Lisp distribution for building web services.
