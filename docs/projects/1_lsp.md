   - Abstract protocol handler supporting multiple RPC protocols
   - Error codes and proper LSP specification compliance

2. **Core LSP Server** - Basic lifecycle and document management
   - Initialize/shutdown lifecycle with capability negotiation
   - Text document synchronization (didOpen, didChange, didClose)
   - Method dispatch system for LSP requests and notifications
   - Separation between protocol and implementation logic

3. **Code Analysis Engine** - Foundation for semantic understanding
   - Symbol extraction from Lisp code (functions, variables, packages)
   - Document analysis with position tracking and range information
   - Syntax error detection using the reader
   - Utility functions for position/offset conversion

4. **Workspace Management** - Multi-project support
   - Multi-folder workspace tracking
   - Document-to-analysis mapping with symbol indexing

   - Foundation for cross-file analysis

5. **Build Integration** - Integration with Epsilon
   - Proper module structure with package.yaml configuration
   - Builds successfully within Epsilon's build system (8 files compiled)
   - Test infrastructure with unit tests for core components
   - Distributed with standalone runtime distributions

**Current Capabilities:**
- Basic LSP client communication via JSON-RPC 2.0
- Document synchronization and change tracking
- Symbol extraction and workspace indexing
- Syntax error detection and reporting
- Ready for IDE feature implementation
