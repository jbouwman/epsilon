## Conclusion

Epsilon has excellent foundational architecture that can support world-class application development. The gaps are primarily in developer experience, modern web protocols, and ecosystem maturity rather than fundamental design issues.

The proposed roadmap would make Epsilon competitive with established frameworks while maintaining its unique advantages in functional programming, cross-platform support, and performance. The total effort of ~40-50 weeks could be parallelized across multiple developers to achieve world-class status within 6-8 months.
