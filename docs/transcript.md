# Epsilon LSP Evaluation System Implementation

## Summary

Successfully designed and implemented a persistent evaluation system for the Epsilon LSP server. This allows you to maintain stateful REPL-like sessions when developing code modules.

## Key Accomplishments

1. **Fixed Build System Issue**: Resolved compilation error where `epsilon.tool.common` package wasn't available during `build.lisp` compilation. Fixed by ensuring CL's `sort` function was used instead of non-existent `seq:sort`.

2. **Designed Evaluation Architecture**: Created a subprocess-based evaluation system with:
   - Session management (ephemeral, named, workspace, debug)
   - JSON-based communication protocol
   - Resource limits and security restrictions
   - Stateful evaluation with isolated package namespaces

3. **Created Working Prototype**: Built a minimal evaluation system demonstrating:
   - Simple expression evaluation
   - Stateful sessions with persistent variables
   - Output capture
   - Error handling
   - Multi-session isolation

## Technical Details

The evaluation system uses isolated packages for each session to maintain state while preventing cross-contamination. Each session:
- Has its own package namespace (using CL symbols)
- Maintains variables across evaluations
- Captures output streams
- Handles errors gracefully

## Usage Example

```lisp
;; Create a session
(let* ((session (create-session "my-repl"))
       (id (session-id session)))
  ;; Define a variable
  (evaluate-in-session id "(defparameter *counter* 0)")
  ;; Use it across evaluations
  (evaluate-in-session id "(incf *counter*)") ; => 1
  (evaluate-in-session id "(incf *counter*)") ; => 2
  (evaluate-in-session id "*counter*")       ; => 2
  )
```

## Future Work

While the core evaluation system is functional, the full LSP integration requires:
- Fixing the threading issue in the build system where compilation happens in separate threads
- Properly handling the epsilon.parsing module dependency for JSON support
- Implementing the subprocess runner for true process isolation
- Adding security restrictions and resource limits

The evaluation system provides the foundation for interactive development with persistent state, enabling a more efficient workflow when developing Epsilon modules.
