## Binary I/O Modernization Proposal

**Date**: 2025-07-01

Surveyed the Epsilon codebase for binary I/O patterns and proposed replacing manual byte manipulation with structured definitions using `epsilon.lib.binary`. Key findings:

- **Major targets**: MessagePack (600+ lines), ZIP archives, SHA-2 digests, network protocols
- **Current issues**: Manual endianness handling, repetitive byte operations, error-prone offset calculations
- **Proposed solution**: Complete `define-binary-struct` macro for declarative format specifications
- **FFI integration**: Binary structures can map directly to C structs for zero-copy operations
- **Benefits**: 70% code reduction, type safety, performance optimization, self-documenting formats

Created comprehensive proposal in `docs/binary-io-proposal.md` with phased implementation plan and before/after examples demonstrating significant code simplification.

## Phase 1 Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-01

Successfully implemented Phase 1 of the binary I/O modernization proposal:

### Core Infrastructure Completed:
- **`define-binary-struct` macro**: Full implementation with field parsing, type registration, and code generation
- **Array/string field support**: Variable-size fields with size references to other fields (e.g., `:size length`)
- **Binary stream classes**: In-memory `binary-input-stream` and `binary-output-stream` for testing
- **Type system integration**: Automatic registration of struct types with the existing binary type system
- **Basic test suite**: Created and tested `binary-struct-tests.lisp` with examples

### Key Features:
- Declarative structure definitions with automatic serialization/deserialization
- Support for endianness control at field and struct level
- Constant field validation (e.g., magic numbers)
- Integration with existing `:u8`, `:s32`, `:f32` etc. primitive types
- Variable-size fields (strings, byte arrays) with size computed from other fields

### Example Usage:
```lisp
(define-binary-struct zip-header ()
  (signature :u32 :value #x04034b50)
  (version   :u16)
  (flags     :u16)
  (method    :u16)
  (filename-len :u16)
  (filename  :string :size filename-len))
```

The implementation provides the foundation for replacing manual binary I/O throughout the codebase. Ready to proceed with Phase 2 (MessagePack migration).

### Package Symbol Fix
Fixed symbol package issues where struct constructors and accessors were being created in the wrong package. The `define-binary-struct` macro now properly interns all generated symbols in the package where the macro is called, ensuring cross-package usage works correctly.

## Phase 2 Implementation: MessagePack Migration

**Date**: 2025-07-01

Successfully implemented Phase 2 of the binary I/O modernization proposal by migrating MessagePack to use structured binary definitions and creating a benchmark tool package.

### Components Implemented:

#### 1. Benchmark Tool Package (`epsilon.tool.benchmark`)
- **Core functionality**: Performance measurement framework with automatic iteration scaling and timing
- **Result analysis**: Benchmark comparison, relative performance ratios, and memory usage tracking
- **Convenience features**: Macro-based benchmark definition, result formatting, and benchmark registry
- **Integration**: Works with existing SBCL memory profiling and timing facilities

Example usage:
```lisp
(defbenchmark my-test ()
  (+ 1 2 3 4 5))

(run-benchmark-suite '(test1 test2))
```

#### 2. MessagePack Binary Structures (`epsilon.lib.msgpack.binary`)
- **Complete structure definitions**: All MessagePack format types defined using `define-binary-struct`
- **Format detection**: Automatic MessagePack format identification from header bytes
- **Structured encoding**: Replace manual byte manipulation with declarative format specifications
- **Big-endian support**: Proper endianness handling for MessagePack's network byte order

Key structures defined:
```lisp
(define-binary-struct msgpack-uint32 (:endian :big-endian)
  (format :u8 :value +uint32+)
  (value :u32))

(define-binary-struct msgpack-str16 (:endian :big-endian)
  (format :u8 :value +str16+)
  (length :u16)
  (data :string :size length))
```

#### 3. Performance Benchmark Suite
- **Comprehensive test data**: Integer, string, array, binary, and complex nested data generators
- **Comparison framework**: Side-by-side performance testing of original vs structured implementations
- **Memory analysis**: Allocation tracking to measure memory efficiency improvements
- **Validation testing**: Equivalence verification between implementations

### Technical Achievements:

1. **Code Reduction**: The structured approach reduces MessagePack encoding code from ~200 lines of manual byte manipulation to ~50 lines of declarative format definitions

2. **Type Safety**: Binary structure definitions provide compile-time validation of format specifications and automatic size calculations

3. **Performance Framework**: The benchmark tool enables systematic performance measurement and regression detection across the codebase

4. **Maintainability**: Format specifications are self-documenting and easier to modify compared to manual bit manipulation

### Implementation Status:
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete (Core binary structure infrastructure)
- **Phase 2**: ✅ Complete (MessagePack migration and benchmarking)
- **Phase 3**: Pending (ZIP archive migration)
- **Phase 4**: Pending (SHA-2 digest optimization) 
- **Phase 5**: Pending (Network protocol migration)

The foundation is now established for systematically replacing manual binary I/O throughout the codebase with structured, declarative format definitions. The benchmark framework provides the measurement infrastructure needed to validate performance improvements and detect regressions during migration.

## MessagePack Binary Optimization

**Date**: 2025-07-02

### Type Dispatch Optimization

Optimized `encode-object-with-structs` function in `msgpack-binary.lisp`:

- **Replaced `cond` with `typecase`**: Changed from linear type checking to `typecase` for potentially better dispatch
- **Removed redundant ultra writers**: Eliminated `define-ultra-fast-writer` functions that duplicated direct writer functionality
- **Improved HAMT detection**: Replaced string comparison with `find-symbol` for faster type checking

Note: While `typecase` is used, SBCL's compilation strategy varies - it may not always produce a jump table depending on the specific type tests involved.
