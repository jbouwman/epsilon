## Known Issues to Fix
1. Some tests use undefined macros/functions (c:with-memoization)
2. is-thrown macro syntax needs parentheses around condition type
3. Tape node count expectations need adjustment (shared nodes)
4. Missing fibonacci operation in auto-eval tests

## Recommendations for Next Steps
1. Fix remaining syntax issues in tests
2. Implement mocking/stubbing for unimplemented features
3. Add proper skip statements for features planned for future
4. Focus on completing one major feature area at a time:
   - Start with completing auto-evaluation (memoization)
   - Then advanced autodiff features
   - Finally e-graph equality saturation

## Architecture Notes
- Clean separation between symbolic, autodiff, and evaluation layers
- Efficient use of HAMTs (epsilon.map) for immutable data structures
- Good foundation for GPU acceleration (native backend ready)
- Tape-based autodiff allows for memory checkpointing implementation
