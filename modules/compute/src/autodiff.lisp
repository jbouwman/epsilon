;;;; STUB: Simplified Automatic Differentiation
;;;;
;;;; TODO: This is a stub implementation of automatic differentiation.
;;;; A complete implementation needs:
;;;;   - Dual number arithmetic for forward mode
;;;;   - Reverse mode tape construction and backpropagation  
;;;;   - Higher-order derivatives support
;;;;   - Integration with symbolic expression evaluation
;;;;   - Efficient memory management for large computation graphs
;;;; 
;;;; Current implementation returns placeholder values for compilation.
