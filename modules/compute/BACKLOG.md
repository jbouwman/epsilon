## Technical Debt

2. **Naming consistency**: Mix of naming conventions (kebab-case vs camelCase in some places)
3. **Dead code**: Some stub implementations could be removed or clearly marked
4. **Test organization**: Tests could be better organized by functionality
5. **Performance**: Many operations allocate unnecessarily, could benefit from in-place operations
